#Piece of Cake
A complement to Faster-Than-Pie.
Piece of Cake is a Node.js project using Express Portfinder and EJS 

##What it does
	Currently FTP users can send requests via the FTP Client but what if they're on the go?
	PoC is a simple node.js app that is runnable on your server for handling these requests.

##How
	A user goes to your default domain (which redirects you to the app)
	You make the website, and they send the request into the app
	The app takes the form request and writes it to the spec file
	This file is then parsed and placed on the homepage
	 
##public_html
	This folder contains a sample of the redirecting service available in PoC.
	It isn't necessary to have this service, but it is added here just in case.
